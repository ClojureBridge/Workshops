# Workshops

This is the repository of ClojureBridge workshops. Please file an issue to
get started. Board members are watching this repository. If an organizer neeeds
a help, add a comment to the issue.

Every workshop should have a mentor from one of current (or past) board members.
Even though, you have an experience of organizing ClojureBridge in the past,
you should contact to the mentor. This is because things are often updated.

When your workshop is ready to annouce at [clojurebirge.org](http://clojurebridge.org), add an announcement
to your workshop issue. The announcement template is in this repository
[announcement-template.md](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/Workshops/blob/master/announcement-template.md).
To fill out the template see: [Workshop Event Listing Guide](#workshop-event-listing-guide).

Based on the information provided in the issue, one of the board
member will create a website. (What they do is copy&pasting markdown annotated texts
to Rails admin console. Markdown rendering would be 'best effort,' not perfect,
unfortunately.)

For a list of past and upcoming workshops, see [Workshops](http://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/workshops.html).

## Reading list prior to the annoucement

- [Guidance To Men's Attendance](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/organizing/blob/master/Guidance-to-Mens-Attendance.md)

## Workshop Event Listing Guide

Copy and paste the [Announcement Template](announcement-template.md)
into a GitHub issue with your event title as the title. More explanation
for each of the template elements is below.

---

### Event title

For example, "ClojureBridge Edinburgh" or "ClojureBridge Workshop for
Women")

### Location

**Locale:** For US locations, we'll just use the two-character state
code.  For all other locations, use a common, memorable name for your
workshop's location (e.g. City, Country).

**Venue:** Full address. Should be able to be copied and pasted into
Google Maps search and result in a pointer to the workshop venue.

### Description

A paragraph or two on the event. Include information on who can register
for the workshop. (e.g. "Men may attend as a woman's guest.") For
example:

> *If you are focusing on a particular constituency, include text like the
> following: "This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are new
> to Clojure. To register, you must identify as a woman."*
>
> In this workshop, we'll {INSERT CONTENT HERE}. We'll meet up Friday
> night to install all of the software you need, and then spend workshop
> day learning and writing code.
>
> Total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other
> languages, and folks who attended our previous workshops are all
> welcome. We'll have 5-7 different classes separated by experience level.
> Each participant needs to bring his or her own computer.
>
> When you RSVP you'll be asked a few question about your operating
> system, level and type of programming experience, and whether you will
> require childcare. Childcare and private space for nursing or pumping is
> available -- just let us know.
>
> (Sometimes people ask if the Friday night installfest is mandatory, and
> yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already
> gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving
> parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that
> we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every
> single student has had their dev environment checked and has been
> awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing
> parts that even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should
> attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes
> almost constantly.)
>
> We are looking for additional volunteers, both folks who know Clojure to
> TA and people who are willing to help with logistics. Please sign up
> here: {LINK TO VOLUNTEER REGISTRATION}
>
> If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is
> to email organizer.
