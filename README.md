## :rocket: Getting Started

This is the repository of ClojureBridge workshops. Please file an issue to
get started. Board members are watching this repository. If an organizer needs
help, add a comment to the issue.

When you open an issue, you will be assigned a mentor from the ClojureBridge board.
This person will help walk you through the process of organising your workshop and is
your point of contact for any questions.

When your workshop is ready to announce at [clojurebridge.org](http://clojurebridge.org),
[open an issue](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/Workshops/issues/new).
See [Workshop Event Listing Guide](#workshop-event-listing-guide) for details.

Based on the information provided in the issue, one of the board
member will create a website.
