# Guide to Listing Your Event on the ClojureBridge Website

Everything you need to know about registering your event on https://clojurebridge.org .

To register your event, you need to [open an issue](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/Workshops/issues/new/choose) for your workshop, and fill out the issue template.

This guide walks you through each of the fields in the template.

---

### Event title

For example, "ClojureBridge Edinburgh" or "ClojureBridge Workshop for
Women")

### Location

**Locale:** For US locations, we'll just use the two-character state
code.  For all other locations, use a common, memorable name for your
workshop's location (e.g. City, Country).

**Venue:** Full address. Should be able to be copied and pasted into
Google Maps search and result in a pointer to the workshop venue.

### Description

A paragraph or two on the event. Include information on who can register
for the workshop. (e.g. "Men may attend as a woman's guest.") For
example:

> *If you are focusing on a particular constituency, include text like the
> following: "This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are new
> to Clojure. To register, you must identify as a woman."*
>
> In this workshop, we'll {INSERT CONTENT HERE}. We'll meet up Friday
> night to install all of the software you need, and then spend workshop
> day learning and writing code.
>
> Total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other
> languages, and folks who attended our previous workshops are all
> welcome. We'll have 5-7 different classes separated by experience level.
> Each participant needs to bring his or her own computer.
>
> When you RSVP you'll be asked a few question about your operating
> system, level and type of programming experience, and whether you will
> require childcare. Childcare and private space for nursing or pumping is
> available -- just let us know.
>
> (Sometimes people ask if the Friday night installfest is mandatory, and
> yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already
> gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving
> parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that
> we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every
> single student has had their dev environment checked and has been
> awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing
> parts that even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should
> attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes
> almost constantly.)
>
> We are looking for additional volunteers, both folks who know Clojure to
> TA and people who are willing to help with logistics. Please sign up
> here: {LINK TO VOLUNTEER REGISTRATION}
>
> If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is
> to email organizer.
